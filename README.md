# DNA

## What? Why?
This dump contains over 720.000 SNP's ([Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism)) from my DNA.

I've decided to publish this following the example of various other GitHub users such as [EvanDotPro](https://github.com/EvanDotPro/dna-data) and [msporny](https://github.com/msporny/dna), in order to support research in genetics, and to help developers who are in need of accurate data to test their code and tools on.

In addition I'm making my data available to the [Personal Genome Project](https://www.personalgenomes.org/).

## Can I send pull requests?
Please, in case you find any bug or virus in my genetic code, or find a way to increase caffeine absorption, feel free to submit a pull request. Next production release might take a while, though.
